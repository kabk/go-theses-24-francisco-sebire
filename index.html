            In the genesis of Reggaeton, its roots were in working-class Panama before expanding across the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. The early 2000s witnessed its transformation into one of the world's most pervasive music genres, transcending cultural boundaries. Nonetheless, reggaeton has elicited prejudice from different points of its history, stemming from the time of its raw and underground origins in poor communities. Accusations of promoting anti-values like commodity fetishism, sexism, and homophobia persist, casting shadows on its cultural significance. Having grown up with reggaeton, it was the first genre I experimented with as a musician and DJ, and to this day, it remains a defining element in my work. My strong link to the genre sparked my interest in the understanding of these sounds, as well as the history, politics and social issues behind them. The truth is, despite being labeled "low class" and "inferior," Reggaeton remains resilient, it persists, prompting an important question: Can we separate the art of reggaeton from these misconceptions?

          <p>
            Aside from a historical overview and analysis on the genre, questions arise from its inclusion in the mainstream and its appropriation on dance floors in the Global North:         <br>
      
            What is the future of reggaeton?<br/>
            Has the adaptation of reggaeton into the mainstream gone too far?<br/>
            Is reggaeton dead?<br/>

          </p>
            <p>
              Through music, history and opinion, this thesis aims to deconstruct Reggaeton — and defend it.

            With reggaeton comes history, artistry, criticism and of course, change, 
            like most genres. It’s been a known genre for at least 25 years, passed 
            by every dance floor, deemed trashy and then popular. As it has become 
            popular, it should be contextualised and understood. Should we give 
            grace to this genre despite all the condemnation? 

            What is the global future of reggaeton? To understand this we need 
            to look at its roots, its iterations and the reactions it has gathered. 
            With so much change and adaptation, many consider reggaeton to be dead.
          <p class="bodytext-main">Is it?</p>  
          <p class="bodytext-main">
            I have no interest in misconstruing facts to my own agenda. 
            Some things are just true. There’s things that have been said and 
            done that no one should be proud of, just like there are things that 
            I have done that I’m not proud of either. Things just <i>are</i>. We can’t 
            change anything that happened before, all we can do is educate ourselves. 
            It’s impossible to talk about this genre of music without mentioning the 
            social issues linked to it. Reggaeton has been heavily criticised, notably 
            for how it negatively represents women and promotes violence and crime. 
            This is the reality linked to this music that can’t be erased, but is 
            this all reggaeton is about? All these negative connotations culminated
            into various campaigns against reggaeton at different moments of its 
            development. For many, reggaeton is synonymous with all these problematic 
            stances to social issues. In my opinion, reggaeton is a rhythm with a rich 
            cultural background, it’s a story of migration and resistance. It’s so much 
            more than all the stigma and misconceptions about it. To observe reggaeton 
            through these negative connotations is simply limiting, which is why I 
            see an urgency in defending the genre by looking at it through a different 
            lens.</p>

            Most of my life I lived in Canada, a country with a rich immigrant community, 
            where multiculturalism is a cultural standard in big cities. My mother is Spanish, 
            but she was born in Venezuela, her friend group was mostly women from Latin American 
            countries as well. I remember discovering reggaeton when I was five or six years old

                I could say that day changed my life. The catchy rhythm stuck with me. 
            It was something we weren’t really allowed to listen to, although I never 
            understood why. I’ve never lived in a Latin American country and only lived 
            in Spain for an Erasmus semester during my time in art school, but I was 
            exposed to <i>latinidad</i> — or “Latin-American-ism” in Canada and through other 
            relatives. I now produce, DJ and sing over reggaeton.</p>

              asks me for an explanation, which is fair. “Euro”… like the continent? the 
              currency?– is it referring to a single euro coin or the entire money system? 
              And then there’s “witch”, which is a weird thing to add. A witch is rarely 
              seen as a positive character, but I always loved that. I remember my mother 
              calling women with ill intentions as “brujas”—the Spanish word for “witch”. 
              “Es una bruja” — She’s a witch. I loved it. I picture the evil female character 
              in a <span class="hover-container"><i>telenovela</i>⋆<span class="hover-content">
                <img class="spanimage" src="assets/images/TELENOVELA.png">

              mean, calculating, ambitious… I now see myself in these women. After realising my 
              queerness as a teenage boy, I named myself “Eurowitch” on Instagram. At the time I 
              wasn’t thinking about this being a testimony of my early exploration of an alter ego, 
              my femininity, my hidden mischief… I was 14 years old when I changed my instagram 
              handle from “franciscosebire” to “eurowitch”, and that shit stuck. My friends 
              started to call me ‘Euro’. All my music shit was made under the name 
              “Eurowitch” because that was my online presence.  The name kind of worked 
              because I was living in Montreal, Canada. Having family in Europe kind of made 
              it make sense, exotifying myself in a way. In these teenage moments, I pictured 
              “Eurowitch” as a brand, a project, an alter ego. “Eurowitch” allowed me to separate myself 
              from everything I knew. It was a way to construct an ultra-confident version of myself beyond 
              the confines of a Canadian suburban high school life.

            I moved to the Netherlands to study, a very wealthy European country where work and 
            productivity is praised (not that much different than in Canada). At the same time 
            I started making music, taking it seriously. Despite the reason for the name 
            “Eurowitch” coming into existence was just to have a different-sounding instagram title,
            I’ve given it an explanation a few months after starting to perform as an artist and DJ.

            Conjuring cash, conjuring money, making it happen, hustling; that’s what I’m about. 
            You <i>need</i> money to live comfortably, which is something I am open about in my work. 
            My name is Eurowitch, but I love all currencies. Reggaeton itself has a conflicting 
            relationship with it, but honestly… <i>who doesn’t love money</i>? I love money, like… 
            my goal is to look good, smell good, have Swarovski teeth gems and not have a 
            fucking worry in the world. Of course money doesn’t remove all the worries you 
            could have, but try to explain that to someone who is breaking a sweat earning 
            nothing, trying to feed their families. Tell that to the early creators of reggaeton 
            who were from lower income communities. I feel like we love to stick to the “money 
            is bad” attitude, which it is, <i>duh</i>, but like what the fuck should I do, starve? 
            Of course there’s more to life than just money. I’ll say that it can be quite 
            blinding to be obsessed with it and show it off, but from another angle it 
            can also be powerful. I see power in being a loud-ass, flashy-ass bitch, with the 
            biggest bottle in the club and the freshest haircut while being able to hold up a 
            conversation about “intellectual” shit like politics, culture, math or science.
             It’s funny how we say “don’t judge a book by its cover”… this usually applies 
             to people who appear not to care about their appearance, people who blend in. 
             I rarely hear this phrase when it comes to people who dress up, listen to
              reggaeton and are open about acquiring money. Even within my field of 
              work—the title above the diploma I receive after I graduate, 
              will have to be related to money. Graphic design is generally 
              a practice of business… offering a service for money. With that money 
              we do what we see fit, but we are definitely weaved into a capitalist system,
               playing the game. Simply put, judging people on how open they are bout money
                is funny to me for the very reason that we <i>all</i> are involved in this system 
                one way or another.

            Is this perpetuated by capitalism and consumerism? Absolutely. But they’re playing the fucking game. 
            They are using the tools they have to express their desires. Isn’t that what we all do in the arts? 
            Don’t we as a culture represent our realities? Our ideals? People who label <i>reggaetoneros</i> as “trashy”, 
            “arrogant” or “show-offs”  see this as an excuse to discard and put down the genre even more without 
            understanding its context. When people argue that a genre solely exists for the promotion of “anti-values” 
            like commodity fetishism, it’s an opportunity to understand where this music genre is coming from. It’s so 
            easy to use the blanket statement “reggaeton is bad and immoral” just because of certain musical artists 
            singing about obtaining money and objects. Music makes culture, but the stories behind this music come 
            from already existing problems and phenomenons. These stories come from reality.

              As a singer, producer and DJ, I’ve seen reggaeton’s change, adaptation and, ultimately, bastardisation. 
              There’s so many points in history where we have seen art forms change in nature to be more palatable to a 
              different audience, I believe this has happened many times with reggaeton. It’s important to remember that 
              this genre started in Panama. As I mention time and time again, the construction of the reggaeton musical 
              structure is directly linked to the African diaspora. It’s also rooted in poor black communities that faced 
              troubling social issues.

            <p class="bodytext-main"><span id="quotes">Reggaeton had its conception in the 1980s when Jamaican workers traveled to 
              Panama to help build the Panama Canal and reggae was adapted to the Spanish-speaking culture. In the 1990s, 
              the genre made its way to Puerto Rico via Jamaican immigrants”.</span> <br>—maquettewire.org

            <p class="bodytext-main"><span id="quotes">“Reggaeton, at times mistakenly referred to as reggae or reggae in Spanish, is a 
              younger genre that originated in Puerto Rico in the 1990s. The preferred spelling on the island is “regueton,” 
              following the Puerto Rican custom of adding the suffix “ton” to a word for emphasis. Thus, “regueton” means 
              “super reggae,” reggae Puerto Rican style. The new genre synthesised Spanish reggae from Panama and hip-hop 
              with Latin American and Caribbean rhythms such as Salsa. Over the past decade, it has become one of the most 
              popular genres in Spanish-speaking Caribbean countries such as Puerto Rico, Panama, the Dominican Republic, 
              Cuba, Colombia and Venezuela. It has extended throughout Latin America and within mainstream Western music. 
              It emerged from youth culture seeking to express itself, and existed on the fringes of society and the law. 
              It depicted the troubles of inner-city life with sexually-charged content and explicit lyrics about drugs, 
              violence, poverty, friendship and love. It was found threatening and deemed immoral and artistically-deficient. 
              The Puerto Rican Police launched a campaign against it, confiscating cassette tapes from music stores under penal 
              obscenity codes, levying fines and demonising rappers in the media as “irresponsible corrupters of the public order.” 
              The Department of Education banned baggy clothing from schools. Bootleg recordings and word of mouth became the primary 
              means of distribution of the underground music”.</span> — musicorigins.org

            <p class="bodytext"> I ultimately wanted to know about her thoughts on 
              <i>blanqueamiento</i> , this term that has been used time and time again to describe 
              the changes the genre has undergone to satisfy a more global audience—a more 
              commercial one. From a racial point of view, she explains how it’s literally 
              being bleached, whitened. The majority of reggaeton artists are white or white passing. 
              She explains how reggaeton, being a genre starting from dissidence and protest, 
              is not only being cleaned up in terms of its content and subject matter, but 
              whitened in terms of the people performing it. 
            </p>

            <p class="bodytext-main"> Latin America is a very complex continent that is often 
              generalised as containing a single unified race. Racial issues in the 
              continent are complex and varying from area to area, but that doesn’t sell. 
             <span id="quotes"> “The bleaching of reggaeton is something that happened—or is happening— 
              with the majority of genres. Let’s say that reggaeton was 
              ‘dirty’, ‘low class’, ‘ghetto’, until it started to get bleached. 
              Before, reggaeton didn’t have a prize category in the Latin Grammys, 
              it wasn’t taken into account for many things like brand deals until 
              it started to get bleached. Here in Latin America, white & mestizo 
              (mixed race) people often proclaim to be part of one big race, […] 
              when in reality these people represent the elite. Under these measures, 
              they exercise practices of oppression towards others truly racialised”. </span>
            </p>


            <p class="bodytext-main"> Reggaeton comes from a set of complex issues. 
              Mainstream music services have pushed a specific narrative of reggaeton 
              for it to sell, disregarding the black origin of the genre. 
              Through speaking to LoMaasBello, I’ve gained a perspective 
              on my research that is out of my context. 
              Looking through the lens of a trans Afro-Colombian 
              artist that understands her social impact in her practice 
              has helped me further understand all these complexities. 
              It’s inspiring to see how LoMaasBello can understand the 
              roots of this genre while representing her communities with pride.
            </p>

            <p class="bodytext-main"> How do we un-bleach reggaeton—if it is 
              indeed being “bleached”… Being a white man creating reggaeton 
              while benefitting from systems of power in the Global North, 
              am I not part of the problem? Am I also bleaching reggaeton? 
              As with most issues, I don’t think it’s that simple to have an 
              answer. Music is constantly flowing from culture to culture. 
              According to Ruka Hatua-Saar White’s article on cultural 
              appropriation in music for Berklee, “Borrowing from other 
              cultures is inevitable, but there are positive ways in 
              which it can be done. We should engage with other cultures 
              on more than just an aesthetic level”.
            </p>

            <p class="bodytext-main"> Artists who produce reggaeton should 
              know what it’s about, as in, its history and background. 
              Inevitably, people who are from the areas where reggaeton 
              was developed will most likely understand these complexities… 
              Others, such as myself, should be able to “back up” their work 
              with facts… How are you gonna take from another culture without 
              wanting to understand as much as you can behind it? To me, 
              it’s clear that it can only bring benefits to respect another 
              culture overall, especially when it comes to their means of 
              expression. Despite this, this subject is not black and white; 
              all this is of course subjective… No one is being forced into 
              following this way of seeing music production (and art-making 
              in general), <u>but it’s important to observe the footprint left 
                by the ones that walked before us</u>.
            </p>


            <p class="bodytext-main"> It’s important to read the room. 
              Reggaeton generally being so flashy and visual, 
              tends to show the main artist as powerful, at the 
              top of their game. <u>Who is being protagonised?</u>
            </p>

            <p class="bodytext-main"> I think people are usually surprised 
              that I’m such a fan of reggaeton and the culture behind it. 
              When I started making it, it brought similar reactions. 
              In the social context where this genre was born, homosexuality

              sex and homosexuality”.

                gaining success before being shot in 2019. Many suspect singer 
                Ozuna to be involved in his death over concerns of blackmailing; 
                exposing a relationship they might’ve had. Ozuna later confirmed 
                he was in a gay porn video when he was allegedly underage, which 
                was also often mentioned by the killed singer. To this day, no 
                one knows who is responsible for Kevin Fret’s death, but in a 
                homophobic, male-dominated society, this seems like much more 
                than a coincidence.

              <p class="bodytext-main">I’ve often said that my love for 
                reggaeton trumps the heteronormativity that surrounds 
                it. To put it simply, I would rather go to a party 
                that plays urban music than a party that shields 
                itself from anything that isn’t queer. This could 
                sound shocking, but I believe the scene has changed overall.
              </p>

              <p class="bodytext-main">Newer generations are definitely 
                more accepting of LGBTQ+ identities within their music 
                sphere, and diversification of reggaeton has offered a 
                lot more room for expression. We now have mainstream

                Tokischa as queer references in the genre. But homophobia
                 and transphobia is an every day reality in the whole world, 
                 so there is a lot of work to be done. I don’t see reggaeton 
                 through it’s homophobia, although I will admit that it 
                 definitely exists, but instead of denouncing an entire 
                 genre, the solution lies in denouncing society and it’s 
                 individuals. For me, a “safe space” can be a great tool 
                 for people to be shielded from potential harm, but I see 
                 my work, and the work of countless others, to open up 
                 <i>existing</i> spaces to the idea of queer acceptance.

              <p class="bodytext-main"><u>Queering a space </u>more radical than 
                creating a new one. I love reggaeton as a rhythm, a genre. 
                <i>Real</i> reggaeton — <i>reggaeton de la mata</i>. I don’t want to lose
                 this essence; on the contrary, I wish to see it accessible 
                 for queer people too.

              </p>

              <p class="bodytext-main"><u>I’ve never really been at risk 
                in my context to perform my tracks, but in different 
                contexts I could be.</u> Being openly Queer and making 
                reggaeton is something that isn’t easily done in the 
                countries where the genre was born. I’m in the safety of 
                Europe producing and performing music originating in poor 
                communities and with homophobic discourse. Because I 
                appreciate and respect the cultures behind this music, 
                I want to use my platform to express this appreciation
                as well as the issues that surround the communities where 
                reggaeton is from. The only way to move forward is educating 
                myself as much as I can. I stand for Queer representation, 
                but I also stand for respecting the genre’s roots. 
              </p>

              <p class="bodytext-main">Historically, reggaeton is explicit, and that’s 
                one of the reasons why it’s been so heavily criticised. I don’t 
                know why people are so mad at it, these music genres were made to 
                be played in the club, like what do you expect? People use the club 
                to express their sexuality all the time. Many of us go to the club 
                to seek sexual gratification, reggaeton being so club-heavy is 
                definitely related to this phenomenon. This doesn’t only apply 
                to reggaeton though, as many other genres of music can be heard 
                in clubs globally, relating to the same ideas. I don’t see how 
                anything sexual could be an issue if it’s all consensual. 
                Even if I already don’t fit in the standard when it comes 
                to the mainstream club scene, being queer, I still found a 
                way to express myself and my sexuality with reggaeton. 
              </p>

              <p class="bodytext-main">Because I see reggaeton as <span class="hover-container">ostentatious, raw and unapologetic⋆<span class="hover-content" style="top:25%;">

                to make people dance while telling them who the top bitch is. 
                I’m that bitch. And I’m gonna dress how I want, act how I want 
                and talk about what I want! I’ve been told many times how 
                explicit my lyrics are, and I actually love hearing that. 
                I like the shock, I need people to know how good I fuck. 
                Especially because there’s not enough representation for 
                my sexual orientation in this genre. The thing is, urban 
                rhythms offer space for artists to show their realities. 
                It just so happens that the majority of these artists are 
                straight men, that doesn’t mean that women and LGBTQ+ people 
                can’t use it to express themselves.

              production, but the message behind it. The song is loosely about dancing 
              in the club with a woman, but this explosive start is basically saying 
              “Get out! If you’re not gonna dance and grind with her, get out”!

            <p class="bodytext-main">Superficially, a listener might accuse these

              “If you’re not gonna dance with her, let her shine and treat her

              context of any art form, and a song like this is no exception to that rule. 
              Here, there is a testimony that proves that reggaeton has offered a space 
              for expression in sexuality. My point with this is that instead of jumping 
              to conclusions, we should understand that this art form can be more nuanced.
            </p>

            <p class="bodytext-main">A link can be made with colonisation and the repression 
              of different cultures through catholicism. Pan-African rhythms from enslaved people 
              arrived to Spanish colonies bringing along dancing that was heavily stigmatised. 
              The oppression of African cultures that had a very different, open relationship to 
              sex compared to Europeans did not consider these dances to be provocative or immoral. 
              It’s not far-fetched to say that our “hypersexual” view on reggaeton can be attributed 
              to residual consequences of colonialism. 
            </p>

            <p class="bodytext-main">In religious contexts, sex and sexuality was taboo for a very 
              long time.

            <p class="bodytext-main">Women and their representation are a very central theme in reggaeton. 
              It’s no lie that objectifying women in this music genre is common, which has brought a lot of 
              criticism. A large part of society is convinced that reggaeton is synonymous with women’s 
              oppression, creating unsafe dance spaces where the intentions of certain men could be 
              exasperated by striking lyrics. In many reggaeton tracks, female recording artists would be 
              placed in the forefront of the song without being credited.

              safe to say that sexism is involved. This is why representation matters! Instead of “shutting down” 
              an entire genre because of the sexism and homophobia that surrounded it, why can’t we strive to seek 
              equality in it. We don’t stop watching a specific genre of film or tv show because some of the content 
              under it has been sexist, why would we do the same with reggaeton? Reggaeton has a rich history of 
              migration and resistance, which can apply to other communities. The truth of the matter is that 
              reggaeton is not inherently sexist… it’s surrounding is, the framework behind a specific artist 
              or song is, society is.

              difficult to judge what’s right and wrong. Who really decides that? Of course, women being 
              objectified to the point of perpetuating more sexism in the world is horrible. Feeling 
              uncomfortable in clubs as a woman obviously isn’t a good thing. But to understand this issue 
              it’s important to also accept the context of this genre’s underground beginnings in the Caribbean and Latin America. 
              Women in this geographical and socio-economic context are surrounded by a very different reality than the one in Europe. 
              Demonising ass-shaking and sexual freedom could also be seen as a form of sexism.

                labels, artists and producers focused more on streams and making money than actually making <i>reggaeton de la mata</i>, 
                old school reggeaton that “just doesn’t hit the same way”. There’s a clear difference in production and delivery 
                from reggaeton made in the 2000s versus most of what is heard nowadays.

              <p class="bodytext-main">The truth is, when any genre looses its original target audience to make money, it most likely 
                looses its essence. When I mean “essence” I mean general characteristics and way of rapping which used to be non-negotiables 
                and necessary to producing. When you get on Spotify and look up a “new” reggaeton playlist, it’s definitely many times 
                more aligned to pop than anything else. According to El Chombo, reggaeton has certain characteristics and a way to deliver 
                them, which are rarely being met with popular reggaeton tracks being made today.
              </p>

              <p class="bodytext-main">I would like to mention my own perspective on the matter. A club perspective from the Global North – in a general sense. 
                It’s a bit weird to me when producers (usually European) take vocals from reggaeton tracks and paste them on a techno beat or “deconstruct” a 
                reggaeton rhythm to make it sound different. They make it sound so different that it isn’t reggaeton anymore. I don’t believe these producers 
                deserve brownie points for spicing up a track a bit. It’s definitely a gross generalisation from my end to accuse producers and DJs like this, 
                I’m definitely not speaking from a pure research point of view; this is just my opinion! I just truly believe that there is so much damage in doing 
                this. I don’t want to call it appropriation (when it definitely is), because I feel like that’s an easy way out in this discussion. 
                It’s just straight up weird. I wonder what the reactions to these kinds of “intellectualised”, “techno-fied” and “europeanised” versions of reggaeton 
                would gather from the OG listeners of the genre. Maybe I’m a reggaeton “purist”, but I can’t stand to see the DJ playing after me open up a “<i>Perreo</i>” 
                playlist on the CDJs, and the entire track list is just… rave shit? I don’t know what it is, but call it what it is.

              <p class="bodytext-main">How did reggaeton end up in Europe? It certainly wasn’t an immediate process. <span class="hover-container">The Canary Islands⋆<span class="hover-content" style="top:25%;">

              </span></span> are unofficially the first 
                area outside of Latin America where reggaeton was heard. This small Spanish archipelago off the coast of Morocco has a similar culture to some Latin 
                American countries like Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Cuba. Reggaeton spread from here to the rest of Spain in the 90s and early 2000s, which was 
                then again spread to the rest of Europe. Just like the rest of the world, Spain is divided on the stance of reggaeton’s morality and quality. After all this 
                commercial success and “hype”, today we are saturated with commercial iterations of reggaeton repeating themselves, as well as the dwindling of <i>reggaeton 
                de la mata</i> in clubs… It was cool to milk reggaeton for all it’s worth here in Europe for a while. It’s easy for us to spit it back out real quick to go 
                back to techno or dilute it with pop. This is really one of the cringiest events I’ve witnessed in all music history. Europeans begging for 
                reggaeton in clubs and now that they’re done with it they reject it. I guess this is cultural appropriation at its finest.

              <p class="bodytext-main">I dislike the term “experimental” when it comes to more contemporary producers making reggaeton. Firstly, calling something 
                “experimental”, intellectualising it. It’s saying “we’re better than you” it’s saying “we’re gonna cherry-pick what we like about this genre and 
                we’re gonna make it inaccessible”. You can fuck up reggaeton and deconstruct it, make it sound more contemporary, with newer techniques, 
                fuck, I wouldn’t even care if people said “I wanna <i>challenge</i> what this genre can do, how far it can expand, how crazy I could make it sound”. 
                Don’t get me wrong, there’s newer reggaeton music that has fused with hyperpop that I find truly groundbreaking, but I would never tag it as 
                “experimental”. 
              </p>

              <p class="bodytext-main"><u>In my opinion, reggaeton is truly already experimental. Real <i>perreo</i> is truly experimental.</u> Reggaeton gained commercial 
                success in the early 2000s. But when this genre started, it started with nothing. A mic and a computer, Jamaican music samples, that’s it. 
                To me, this is the definition of experimental. Reggaeton has managed to persist, survive and evolve, mixing itself with electronic sounds, bachata, 
                merengue, calypso, even Indian and Arabic vocals and instruments.
              </p>


              <p class="bodytext-main">Despite my criticism on how reggaeton (and its iterations) have evolved until today, it’s not necessarily 
                something I’m looking to stop. Like in all music genres, I definitely think it’s impossible to halt the borrowing, appropriation 
                and cherry-picking of certain aspects of reggaeton to create new sub-genres. Just like how reggaeton has stemmed from a synthesis of 
                a variety of genres, it’s safe to say that other genres of music have taken from reggaeton to create their own paths. 
              </p>

              <p class="bodytext-main">Appropriation is a subject in the art world that is constantly under debate. Information has never been so accessible, 
                and with a simple google search or AI prompt, we can obtain a plethora of references to create. There is no exact rule book on how 
                to use already existing pieces of work as building blocks to create something new. Even reggaeton itself is based on using samples again 
                and again… There’s even been lawsuits filed agains certain reggaeton producers and artists for illegally using samples from Jamaica… Despite 
                this, I believe there is a way to take from other genres in a way that honours them. Aside from just using sounds that have a certain history 
                to them blindly, why not honour it? We should honour the stories, struggles and development of these sounds, because they hold cultural meaning.  
              </p>

              <p class="bodytext-main">Reggaeton has recently evolved into new independent genres based on geographic location, and cultural adaptation.

              <p class="bodytext-main">It also all goes back down to understanding the roots of the genre. Adapting it to current ways of thinking,

              <p class="bodytext-main"> No music genre just dies from one day to another, as I explored in this thesis, it adapts, changes, transforms, gets forgotten… 
                But this doesn’t delete its legacy. Today, reggaeton is thriving on the charts, despite it not being what it used to be. Some parts of the genre 
                and subculture could be dramatically declared “dead”, but clearly this isn’t all the way true.

              <p class="bodytext-main"> <u>A part of me secretly wishes for reggaeton to stay dead. If it ever truly dies, this would filter out people who

Later, reggaeton gradually moved away from 			reggae, but continued using the same instruments and musical rhythms but with different lyrics and melodies. This 	was because reggae beats were used but with different lyrics and compositions. Similar to salsa, which was a 			cultural expression of Hispanic youth in the early 1970s, reggaeton arrived in the United States in the 1990s 			and 2000s and has become a mode of expression for many Hispanic youth.
